90s Match Game

The 90s Match Game is a basic memory card game where players need to flip cards and find matching pairs. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play

Launch the game by opening the index.html file in a web browser.
The game board will display a set of cards faced down.
Click on a card to flip it and reveal its image.
Click on a second card to reveal its image.
If the image and words on both cards match, the cards will remain face up. If the images on the cards do not match, both cards will be flipped face down again.
Continue flipping pairs of cards until all pairs have been matched.
The game ends when all pairs have been matched. Keep in mind you are not matching pictures to pictures but you are matching words to images.
