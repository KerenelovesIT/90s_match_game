      <h2>How to Play - It's not what you think.</h2>
      <p>The rules of Match Game are simple. You'll be presented with a grid of facedown cards. Each card has a matching pair somewhere on the grid. To win, you need to find all the matching pairs by flipping the cards and remembering their positions. You can only flip two cards at a time, so make sure to use your memory and concentration to match the pairs.</p>
      <p>Click on a card to reveal its image. If the next card you choose matches the first one, the cards will stay face up. If they don't match, they will flip back face down, and you'll have to remember their positions for future turns. The game continues until all the pairs have been found.</p>
